TODO - Image Processor Future Improvements
==========================================

November 5th, 2025
✓ COMPLETED - better interpolation function
    - Implemented bilinear interpolation for upscaling (smooth gradients)
    - Implemented area averaging (box filter) for downscaling
    - Averages all pixels in overlapping source range or target area
    - Much better quality than nearest-neighbor

✓ COMPLETED - UI improvements
    - Display loaded filename under Load button
    - Turn off function acknowledgement dialogs (silent operations)
    - Display selected source image name from log list
    - Visual indicator shows which image is currently selected as source
    - Reopen closed windows when selecting from log

Future Ideas:
- Additional filters (blur, sharpen, edge detection)
- Brightness/contrast adjustments
- Rotation and flip operations
- Histogram equalization
- Batch processing multiple images
- Undo/Redo functionality
