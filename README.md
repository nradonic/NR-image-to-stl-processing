Converts images to STL files for 3D printing. Image formatting and resizing and STL file export, here shown on a Bambu processor screen.
Java language. Cleanup of code with a lot of assistence from Anthropic Claude. 

Claude still needs a lot of hand holding, and guided revisions. But useful too. It breaks on the weirest things, like 
uploading Mac zip files -- just can't read them. Nor is blind retries a good approach, since Claude might not detect
what actually is wrong. Ended uploading problematic STL files to get it to properly close the mesh edges.

The resultant STL files are simplified to surfaces, but may not be most compressed possible.
